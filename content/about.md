Hello busy bees and welcome to my thoughtful hive! 

This is a website my partner created for me so I could have an outlet for my 
love of writing. I have always loved reading and writing but recently I have 
been trying harder to focus on my personal hobbies. I am using the website to 
voice my inner thoughts and ideas so if you don’t agree BUZZ OFF. With that 
being said I always try to stay open minded and willing to communicate so 
eventually I hope to have a comment feature! 

A little about me, I am a mom of 3 busy bees that I love dearly. I am always 
looking for ways to improve not only their little lives but my partner and 
I’s as well. I also love animals, especially wolves, my favorite color is 
yellow (hence the theme), and I enjoy fall and rainy weather the most. 

I hope to use this to inspire and motivate me to do more of the things I like. 
Thank you for being a part of my colony!
