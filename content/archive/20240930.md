Preparing dinner has slowly become one of my favorite things to do, deciding 
dinner is a totally different challenge. The choices just seem endless and 
making the decision is daunting, but executing the meal and sharing with others 
brings so much enjoyment. 

This has made me think of other areas in my life where I have ran into the same 
thing. For example, picking a career path in college vs walking across the stage 
to get my degree. Or leaving an unhealthy job and starting all over somewhere 
new vs loving where my future is going and learning something new every day. 

It seems life is full of those mountain climbs, from small tasks like picking 
dinner to big ones like choosing a future path for your life. While the uphill 
climb can be frustrating and exhausting, the view at the top is worth it.
