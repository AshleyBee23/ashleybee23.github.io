My partner said something to me recently that has really stuck with me. I might 
not always have the best patience and am working through things in therapy so I 
can get overwhelmed at times. But I was having a talk with him about our kids and 
he said to me “There might be a lot on your plate but that little stuffed unicorn 
or the doll the kids always fight over; is their whole world.” 

I am so thankful for him saying that, because sometimes with the stress of bills, 
work, life in general, it’s easy to forget that something so small can mean so much. 
It has helped me everyday since then to take a moment and see things from their 
perspective. 

Another thing I have been trying to do lately (when my mom brain can remember) 
is to ask my partner something he did that day that made him happy or proud. We 
are each others outlets so we tend to vent to each other a lot but its really 
important for us to have the good conversations as well, and asking that question 
helps us get on a positive topic. 

So to end this post, what is something your proud of or that made you happy today?
