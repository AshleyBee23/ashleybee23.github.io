My motivation lately has been low, I see and hear so many negative things in 
the world and it makes me close up. I’ve had so many questions running through 
my mind. Am I a good parent? Am I doing enough? Is this the right job for me? 
What does the future bring? I keep tripping and stumbling through the days and 
weeks, wondering when things will get better. I spent so much of my life holding 
my breath waiting for the “what’s next moment” that I forget to focus on the now 
that is happening. I try my hardest to not focus on the negative, while still 
remembering not to bottle things up. 

I think my mind contradicts itself quite a bit, at least questions itself over 
every little thing, like I’m in defense mode 24/7. I wonder how many people feel 
the same way…

I told myself I did not want to leave this post off on the wrong foot. So I guess 
my last thought for the post is something that I hope might help others in a way. 

Sometimes we need the bad, to appreciate the good. 

And 

While a lot of the time we feel alone in regards to a situation we might be 
dealing with, the world is so vast that there has to be at least one other person 
out there who has felt the same….right?
